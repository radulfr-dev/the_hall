# The Hall

The Hall is a social media network built with a Node.js backend, and a Vue.js frontend.

## Knowledge of Node.js, Vue.js and a demonstration of good practices

Besides wanting to build a social network as a hobby principally, I wanted to create
something that I could use to demonstrate an understanding of not only modern Node
based stacks, but of my ability to plan, build and improve my own, more complex project -
maintaining the best practices that I have learned in the last few years of study.

## The BackEnd: Express.js

The backend is currently imagined to be an Express API, authenticated via middleware
and written using the latest JavaScript features such as classes. This API will
handle all calls - providing a RESTful API from a mySql database or passing any 
routes to the Vue.js frontend where necessary,

## The FrontEnd: Vue.js (with Vue CLI)

The client-side of the project is rendered using Vue.js. I've decided to go for
Vue.js as I already have used Vue components within the context of a Laravel
framework, and I prefer the syntax over React.

## The future of The Hall

Once I have been successful in implementing a social media network within this
stack, I have plans to rebuild it using the Nuxt.js framework, or to create 
another version of it using React instead.
